    <h1>What is Specificity?</h1>
    <pre>
        Specificity is a scoring system used by browsers to determine which CSS rule is applied when multiple rules target the same element.
        Each type of selector contributes a specific "weight" to the specificity score.
       <h2> Specificity Calculation</h2>
        Specificity is calculated based on a three-tier system, often represented as (a, b, c):
        
        <h2>a (Inline styles):</h2> Counts inline styles applied directly to an element (style="...").
        Example: <div> adds 1,000.
       <h2> b (ID selectors): </h2> Counts the number of id selectors.
        Example: #header adds 100.
        <h2>c (Class, attribute, pseudo-class selectors):</h2> Counts the number of these selectors.
        Examples:
        .nav-item (class selector) adds 10.
        [type="text"] (attribute selector) adds 10.
        :hover (pseudo-class selector) adds 10.
        Type and pseudo-element selectors: Adds 1 for each element or pseudo-element selector.
        Examples:
        div adds 1.
        ::before adds 1.
        The universal selector (*) adds 0 points to specificity.
        
        Example: Why does #header have a specificity of 100?
        Selector: #header
        Inline styles (a): There are no inline styles here, so a = 0.
        ID selectors (b): There is 1 ID selector (#header), so b = 1.
        Class/attribute/pseudo-class selectors (c): There are no classes, attributes, or pseudo-classes, so c = 0.
        Specificity = (a, b, c) = (0, 1, 0) = 100
        
        Compare to Other Selectors
        Example 1: .nav-item
        This is a class selector.
        a = 0 (no inline styles), b = 0 (no IDs), c = 1 (1 class).
        Specificity = (0, 0, 1) = 10
        Example 2: div
        This is a type selector.
        a = 0, b = 0, c = 0, d = 1 (1 type selector).
        Specificity = (0, 0, 0, 1) = 1
        What Happens When Selectors Target the Same Element?
        The browser uses the rule with the highest specificity.
      
           <h2> If the HTML is:</h2>
        <div id="header" class="nav-item">Hello!</div>
        div has a specificity of 1.
        .nav-item has a specificity of 10.
        #header has a specificity of 100.
        Result: The #header rule wins because it has the highest specificity (100).
        
       <h1> Key Takeaways</h1>
        Specificity is a score calculated from the type of selectors used in a CSS rule.
        ID selectors (#) are stronger than class selectors (.), which are stronger than type selectors.
        Inline styles always override everything, unless another rule uses !important.</pre>
