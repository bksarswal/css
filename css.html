   <h1> CSS interview questions with their answers:</h1>

<h2>Basic Level</h2>
<h3>1. What is CSS, and why is it used?</h3>
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used to control 
    the presentation of HTML documents, including layout, colors, fonts, 
    and spacing. It separates content from design, improving website
     maintainability

<h3>2. What are the different types of CSS?</h3>

Inline CSS: Applied directly to an HTML element using the style attribute.
    Internal CSS: Defined in the <.style> tag within the <.head> section of 
        the document.
    External CSS: Written in a separate file with a .css extension 
    and linked via <.link>

        <h3>3. What is the difference between id and class selectors?</h3>

id: Unique identifier used for a single element, defined with #.
    css
    Copy code
    #header {.
      color: blue;
    }
    class: Can be used for multiple elements, defined with ..
    css
    Copy code
    .btn {
      background-color: green;
    }</pre>
<h1>Intermediate Level</h1>

<h2>1. How does the CSS box model work?</h2>
The CSS box model consists of the following components:

    Content: The actual content of the box (text, image, etc.).
    Padding: Space between content and border.
    Border: Surrounds the padding.
    Margin: Space outside the border
<h2>2. Explain visibility: hidden vs. display: none.</h2>
visibility: hidden: Hides the element but still occupies space in the layout.
    display: none: Hides the element and removes it from the layout

    <h2>3. What are media queries? Provide an example.</h2>
Media queries are used to apply CSS styles based on device properties 
    like width, height, or resolution.
    
    css
    Copy code
    @media (max-width: 768px) {
      body {
        background-color: lightblue;
      }
    }</pre>

    <h2>4. What is the difference between inline, block, and inline-block elements?</h2>

inline: Does not start on a new line; width/height cannot be set.
    block: Starts on a new line; width/height can be set.
    inline-block: Behaves like inline but allows width/height to be set

    <h1>Advanced Level</h1>

    <h2>1. What are CSS Grid and Flexbox? When should you use each?</h2>

Flexbox: Best for one-dimensional layouts (row or column).
    Example of Flexbox:
    
    css
    Copy code
    .container {
      display: flex;
      justify-content: center;
      align-items: center;
    }
    
    CSS Grid: Designed for two-dimensional layouts (rows and columns).
    Example of Grid:
    
    css
    Copy code
    .container {
      display: grid;
      grid-template-columns: 1fr 1fr;
      gap: 10px;
    }</pre>
<h2>2. How does z-index work in CSS?</h2>
The z-index property specifies the stack order of elements.
    Higher values are displayed in front. It works only for elements
     with a position other than static.
   
   css
   Copy code
   div {
     position: relative;
     z-index: 10;
   }</pre>
<h2>3. What are CSS variables? How are they used?</h2>
CSS variables (custom properties) allow reusability of values.

    css
    Copy code
    :root {
      --main-color: #3498db;
    }
    button {
      background-color: var(--main-color);
    }</pre>

    <h1>Practical Questions</h1>
<h2>1. How would you create a responsive design without a framework?</h2>

Use media queries for responsiveness.
    Use percentages or relative units like em, rem, and vh/vw.
    Apply Flexbox or Grid for layout adjustments.
    Example:
    
    css
    Copy code
    @media (max-width: 600px) {
      .container {
        flex-direction: column;
      }
    }</pre>


  <h1>  Why Use box-sizing: border-box?</h1>
    Simplifies Layouts:
  
    When using border-box, the element's specified width and height remain the same regardless 
    of padding or border. This makes layouts more predictable and easier to manage.
    Responsive Design:
    
    border-box is especially useful in responsive design. It ensures that elements stay within
     their allocated size, even when padding or borders are added.
    Avoids Calculation Errors:
    
    With content-box, you need to manually calculate the total size of an element by adding 
    padding and borders. Using border-box eliminates this need.
    Modern Best Practice:
    
    Most developers use box-sizing: border-box as a universal setting because it aligns with
     how people generally think about element dimensions (width includes everything).   

    <h1>Why Use content-box?</h1>
    Precise Content Dimensions:
    
    content-box ensures that the width and height apply strictly to the content of the element, 
    without considering padding or borders. This is useful for scenarios where the exact content 
    dimensions are critical, such as:
    Designing elements that need to fit into specific containers without additional adjustments.
    Calculating space for dynamic content that relies on a fixed content size.

<h1> When Should You Use content-box?  </h1>                                                                               
    
    Image or Video Containers:
     To maintain consistent rendering when padding or borders are added around media, such as images or videos, without affecting the core dimensions.


<h1>1. What is the difference between id and class selectors in terms of specificity?</h1>
Specificity of id:

An id selector contributes 100 points to specificity.
Example: #header has a specificity of 100.
Specificity of class:

A class selector contributes 10 points to specificity.
Example: .nav-item has a specificity of 10.
Key Difference:

id selectors have higher specificity than class selectors, so styles applied using an id will always override styles applied using a class, assuming they target the same element.
<h1>2. How does the !important declaration affect specificity?</h1>
The !important declaration overrides all other rules, regardless of specificity.

It is applied last in the cascade, even if the rule with !important has lower specificity.

Example:

css
Copy code
p {
  color: blue !important;
}

#paragraph {
  color: red;
}
The text will be blue, because !important overrides the id selector.
Note: Overusing !important can lead to messy and hard-to-maintain styles. It should be used sparingly.

<h1>3. How do pseudo-classes like :hover differ from pseudo-elements like ::before?</h1>
Pseudo-classes (:hover):

Represent a state of an element.
Do not create new content but apply styles based on interaction or conditions.
Example:
css
Copy code
a:hover {
  color: red;
}
This changes the color of a link when hovered.
Pseudo-elements (::before, ::after):

Allow you to style specific parts of an element or add generated content.
Create new content in the DOM that can be styled.
Example:
css
Copy code
p::before {
  content: "Note: ";
  color: gray;
}
This adds the word "Note:" before the content of every paragraph.
<h1>4. What happens if two rules with the same specificity conflict?</h1>
If two rules have the same specificity, the rule defined later in the stylesheet or cascade wins.
Example:
css
Copy code
p {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: green;
}
The text will be green because the second rule is defined later.
<h1>5. How does the universal selector (*) affect specificity?</h1>
The universal selector (*) has no specificity weight (it contributes 0 points).
It is overridden by all other types of selectors.
Example:
css
Copy code
* {
  color: black;
}

p {
  color: red;
}
The paragraph text will be red because the p selector has higher specificity.
