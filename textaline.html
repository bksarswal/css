    3. text-align in CSS
The text-align property in CSS is used to align text horizontally within its container. It's one of the most straightforward and essential text styling properties.

Possible Values of text-align
left

Aligns the text to the left edge of the container.
Default value for most block-level elements in left-to-right (LTR) languages like English.
Example:
css
Copy code
p {
  text-align: left;
}
right

Aligns the text to the right edge of the container.
Useful in right-to-left (RTL) languages or for specific designs.
Example:
css
Copy code
p {
  text-align: right;
}
center

Centers the text within the container.
Example:
css
Copy code
div {
  text-align: center;
}
justify

Spreads text so that each line has equal width, aligning both the left and right edges (except the last line).
Often used in newspapers, books, or professional documents.
Example:
css
Copy code
p {
  text-align: justify;
}
Practical Example
Hereâ€™s an example demonstrating different text-align values:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    .left {
      text-align: left;
    }
    .right {
      text-align: right;
    }
    .center {
      text-align: center;
    }
    .justify {
      text-align: justify;
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <div class="left">This text is aligned to the left.</div>
  <div class="right">This text is aligned to the right.</div>
  <div class="center">This text is centered.</div>
  <div class="justify">
    This text is justified. It stretches so that both the left and right edges are aligned. Notice how the spaces between words adjust to fit the line.
  </div>
</body>
</html>
How It Works
Left: Text aligns naturally to the left.
Right: Text aligns naturally to the right.
Center: Text is positioned in the middle of the container.
Justify: Text expands to fill the width of the container by adjusting word spacing.
Best Practices
Use justify cautiously:
Inconsistent spacing between words might make text harder to read on small screens.
Combine with line height for readability:
Example:
css
Copy code
p {
  text-align: justify;
  line-height: 1.6;
}
Check alignment for RTL languages:
For RTL scripts like Arabic or Hebrew, set the direction property to rtl:
css
Copy code
body {
  direction: rtl;
  text-align: right;
}

Understanding justify in text-align
The justify value for text-align spreads the text so that each line has equal width, aligning both the left and right edges of a block of text. It's commonly used in professional documents like newspapers, books, and reports for a polished and formal appearance.

How justify Works
Spaces Between Words Adjust:

The browser adjusts the spaces between words in each line so that both the left and right sides of the text block align.
The last line in a paragraph does not justify and aligns naturally (left by default).
Good for Wide Text Blocks:

Works best for large blocks of text where spreading spaces doesnâ€™t significantly affect readability.
Example
Hereâ€™s an example using justify:

html
Copy code
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
<head>
  <style>
    .justified-text {
      text-align: justify;
      width: 60%; /* Optional: Sets a width to see the alignment clearly */
      margin: 0 auto; /* Centers the block */
    }
  </style>
</head>
<body>
  <p class="justified-text">
    Justified text ensures that the left and right edges of the paragraph align perfectly, 
    creating a clean and organized look. This style is often used in books, magazines, 
    and formal documents, but it can sometimes create uneven spacing between words, 
    especially in narrow containers.
  </p>
</body>
</html>
Output
The paragraph text will be evenly aligned on both the left and right sides.
The spaces between words will adjust to achieve this alignment.
Advantages of justify
Professional Look: It gives text blocks a neat and organized appearance.
Formal Settings: Suitable for reports, academic documents, newspapers, and magazines.
Disadvantages of justify
Uneven Word Spacing:
On narrow screens or small containers, the spacing between words may become irregular, affecting readability.
Accessibility Issues:
For readers with dyslexia or visual impairments, uneven word spacing can make text harder to follow.
Best Practices
Combine with Line Height:

Increase the line-height to improve readability:
css
Copy code
p {
  text-align: justify;
  line-height: 1.6; /* Adds more space between lines */
}
Avoid for Small Text Blocks:

Use justify only for wide or long paragraphs.
